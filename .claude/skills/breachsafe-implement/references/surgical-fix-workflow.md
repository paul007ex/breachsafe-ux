# Surgical-fix workflow — one bug, one narrow, test-first patch

Use this mode for: a reported defect in existing code, a failing test/lint/type/security
check, a GitHub issue describing a concrete bug, or output/behavior that contradicts the
repo's own docs or tests. This does not define a separate coding standard — the repo's own
coding-standards doc remains authoritative. This adds the bug-fix workflow on top: prove the
root cause, fix it, add the regression test, run the right checks, and self-audit the result.

Don't use this mode for: a new feature/scanner/milestone/architecture change (use the
feature-work bootstrap sequence instead), a review of someone else's proposed fix (that's a
reviewing skill's job), or a defect that only lives in scratch/experimental/archived code (fix
it in product code, or not at all — don't "fix" throwaway prior art).

## Non-negotiables

### 1. Preserve user work

Run `git status --short --branch` first. Treat any unrelated dirty files as user work in
progress — don't revert, reformat, or overwrite them.

### 2. Prove the root cause

Don't patch from the issue title alone. Name the exact function, branch, invariant, or
boundary that's wrong, in one sentence.

Bad: "JSON output is polluted." Good: "The CLI test runner merges stderr into the captured
stdout stream by default, so a test asserting JSON-stdout purity is actually reading a
combined stream, not real process stdout."

If you can't state the root cause in one sentence, keep reading and reproducing — don't patch
yet.

**Boundary/seam check.** If the bug sits at a seam between two systems — subprocess output and
its parser, a library default versus a framework override, a frozen model and its serializer,
two streams being merged, "captured at config time" versus "used at call time" — name both
contracts explicitly:

- *Whose contract is canonical?* (e.g., a structured logger's documented behavior is
  canonical; a test harness silently rebinding a stream is the side that isn't honoring it.)
- *Which side should the fix go on?* Default: fix the canonical side; adapt the other side to
  it. Don't just patch the friction point at the seam if the friction itself is the bug (e.g.
  adding a separator between two streams patches the friction; not merging them in the first
  place is the canonical fix).
- *Could the same bug class recur elsewhere?* A "captured at config time, used at call time"
  bug isn't unique to one module — anything with the same shape has the same latent bug. The
  fix should generalize to the class where it's cheap to do so. **This class isn't limited to
  module-level `sys.stdout`/`stderr` snapshots** — a function default parameter
  (`def render(..., stream: IO[str] = sys.stdout)`) is evaluated once at function-*definition*
  time, the same "captured at config time, used at call time" shape in different syntax. It
  shipped independently in three separate functions (`render_json`/`render_rich`/`render_cbom`)
  in one codebase before anyone generalized the check past module-level globals. When you find
  one instance, grep every stream/`IO`-typed parameter for a non-`None` default, not just
  module-level `= sys.stdout` assignments.

When the seam genuinely can't be removed (cost too high, blast radius too wide), patching the
friction is acceptable — but say so explicitly in the final report under a "deferred
architectural debt" note, so the next reader knows the canonical fix was deferred on purpose,
not missed.

### 3. Test first

Add or tighten a deterministic regression test before changing production code.

- Put it in the existing test file that covers the affected module.
- Use a specific-exception assertion for error cases, not a bare exception check.
- Test observable behavior, not private implementation details, unless the private function
  is already directly tested elsewhere.
- Use a captured real fixture for parser/protocol behavior when the repo has a fixture
  convention (see `test-fixture-capture.md`) — don't invent synthetic input for something a
  real fixture could capture.
- Run the new test before the fix and confirm it fails for the intended reason — not because
  of a fixture-setup mistake or a typo in the test itself.

If no deterministic regression test is possible, stop and explain why rather than shipping an
untested fix.

### 4. Keep the patch surgical

Default patch budget:

- One production file.
- One test file.
- Optional fixture file.
- Optional one-line doc change, only if public behavior or a documented contract changed.

If the correct fix needs two or more production files, stop and report it as not surgical:
name the files the root cause actually spans, and either ask for authorization to widen scope
or recommend the feature-work bootstrap sequence instead. Don't sneak in adjacent fixes,
broad reformatting, renames, helper extraction, dependency changes, or schema cleanup under
cover of the bug fix.

### 5. Follow the repo's coding standards

Apply the target repo's own coding-standards doc to the touched code. Recurring surgical-fix
traps across this codebase family: public functions keep full type hints/docstrings; new
files carry whatever header convention the repo uses (license header, module docstring);
locked models stay locked (see `python-conventions.md`); fixed vocabularies stay enums;
exceptions are specific, not broad `except Exception`; no log-and-raise unless the log adds
context the caller can't reconstruct; no new module-level mutable state, including unwrapped
lookup-table `dict`s (wrap in `types.MappingProxyType`, not just "avoid `list`"); no function
parameter defaulted to a stateful/reassignable object like `sys.stdout` (evaluated once at
def-time, not call-time — same shape as a module-level stream snapshot, via a default argument);
no new `utils.py`/`helpers.py`/vague-rename for a one-bug patch; no commented-out code or
unexplained `TODO`/`noqa`/`fmt: off`.

### 6. Respect public contracts

Bug fixes must not silently change public behavior. Treat these as contracts unless the fix
*is* an explicit, discussed contract change: CLI exit codes, stdout/stderr separation for
machine-readable output, a versioned output schema, locked model fields, distinct
failure/error categories (don't collapse two categories into one to make a bug "go away"),
and any field that's product behavior other code or other repos depend on (finding IDs,
severities, evidence structure, wire-format byte layouts, and similar).

### 7. Refuse security shortcuts

Stop instead of shipping any fix that requires: disabled TLS/certificate verification,
`shell=True` with externally-influenced input, a removed subprocess/network timeout, secret
logging, `eval`/`exec`/`pickle.loads` on untrusted input, a swallowed security-relevant error,
or a changed finding/severity/evidence value without a focused test covering the change. If
asked for one of these, say which rule blocks it and propose the secure alternative.

### 8. Bug-fix coding heuristics

Prefer the boring patch that makes the failing behavior correct: touch the causal branch, not
the surrounding architecture; prefer an explicit conditional over a new abstraction unless a
second real call site already exists; preserve existing names/boundaries unless the boundary
itself is the bug; tighten validation at the trust boundary rather than compensating
downstream; flag adjacent cleanup as a follow-up instead of folding it into the patch.

### 9. Self-audit before final response

If the repo has an anti-pattern/self-audit checklist doc, audit the diff against it before
responding. State either: `Audited against <doc>, no violations` or
`ANTIPATTERN FLAGGED: <name>, because <reason> — needs your sign-off` (a request for the human
to decide, not a self-granted pass — don't proceed as though it's already resolved). Hard
failures to watch for regardless of
whether the repo has a formal checklist: hallucinated codebase knowledge, big-bang edits,
ignoring failing checks, silent behavior changes, fake certainty, speculative generality,
dependency grabs, broad exception handling, logging instead of raising, assertion-free or
implementation-detail-only tests, security shortcuts, public-contract drift without tests,
and quality theater (skipped tests, lowered thresholds, retry-count increases used to hide a
deterministic failure).

## Procedure

1. **Preflight** — `git status --short --branch`; read the issue/test/docs needed; note dirty
   files you won't touch.
2. **Reproduce** — run the smallest command that demonstrates the failure. For CLI output
   bugs, use a mode that keeps stdout and stderr genuinely separate.
3. **Diagnose** — read the code path until the root cause is concrete; note file and function;
   check whether it's product behavior, test-harness behavior, a docs mismatch, or a
   duplicate of an existing issue.
4. **Write the regression test** — add it, run it, confirm it fails for the intended reason.
5. **Patch the root cause** — smallest causal surface, existing local style, standards
   checklist applied while editing.
6. **Verify narrowly** — run the new/changed test, then the nearest affected test file(s).
7. **Verify broadly if any production code changed** — run the repo's Tier-1 local gates (see
   `python-conventions.md` / `rust-conventions.md`). If a gate is unavailable or already red
   for unrelated reasons, report that plainly — don't claim green.
8. **Self-review the diff** — confirm the patch stayed inside the stated boundary and didn't
   silently change a public contract.
9. **Final audit and report.**

## Stop conditions

Stop and ask, or escalate to the feature-work mode, when: the root cause isn't understood; a
deterministic regression test can't be written; the correct fix exceeds the surgical patch
budget; a coding-rule conflict needs a documented exception; a public-contract change is
required to make the fix correct; a security-bar rule would be violated; existing dirty
user changes block a safe patch; or required credentials/network/external state can't be
obtained.

## Final response format

**Audit:**
- Audited against <repo's anti-pattern doc, if one exists>, no violations
- Coding standards checked against <repo's coding-standards doc>, no exceptions

**Scope:**
- Production files changed: <count>
- Test files changed: <count>
- Fixtures changed: <count>

**Follow-up:** <none, or a concrete out-of-scope issue>
```

If stopped:

```markdown
## Surgical Fix Stopped

**Reason:** <specific stop condition>
**Evidence:** <what was read/run>
**Recommendation:** <next action>
```

Never say "fixed" unless the regression test and the relevant verification actually passed.
