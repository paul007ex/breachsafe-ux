#
# Enforce that a breachsafe-ux GitHub Release was ACTUALLY signed -- not merely
# that release.yml *carries* a signing step. A workflow can hold cosign / attest
# steps and still ship an unsigned release because the workflow never executed
# for that tag (the release was left a draft, the workflow was disabled, a tag
# was pushed before signing was added). "A signing step that never ran is not a
# signed release." (Adapted from breachsafe/qureddy's gate for #219/#232.)
#
# This gate FAILS (exit 1) unless ALL of the following hold for <tag>:
#   1. the release exists (gh release view succeeds),
#   2. it is NOT a draft (release: published is what triggers release.yml),
#   3. the wheel  (breachsafe_ux-<v>-py3-none-any.whl) has a sibling
#      <name>.sigstore signature-bundle asset, AND
#   4. the sdist  (breachsafe_ux-<v>.tar.gz)            has a sibling
#      <name>.sigstore signature-bundle asset.
# If cosign and/or `gh attestation` are available it ALSO verifies the bundle /
# SLSA build-provenance cryptographically; when that verification runs and
# fails, the gate fails. Missing verifier tools degrade to the asset-presence
# check (still un-bypassable for "signing never ran") rather than a false pass.
#
# The expected signed shape:
#   breachsafe_ux-<v>-py3-none-any.whl   + .whl.sigstore
#   breachsafe_ux-<v>.tar.gz             + .tar.gz.sigstore
#
# Wire this in as the FINAL job of release.yml, after signing+upload, so a
# release whose signing step silently did not run fails the workflow loudly
# instead of being caught later by an OpenSSF Scorecard drop.
#
# Read-only except a temp download of the release artifacts (cleaned up).
# Deps: gh (authenticated), jq. Optional: cosign, `gh attestation`.
# bash 3.2 safe (macOS default bash).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify_release_signed.sh v0.3.3
#   scripts/verify_release_signed.sh v0.3.3 breachsafe/enxemble
#
# Flags:
#   --simulate-unsigned   pretend the .sigstore assets are absent -- proves the
#                         RED path (unsigned release -> exit 1) without needing
#                         a real unsigned release to point at.
#   --no-verify           skip the cryptographic cosign/attestation step; only
#                         check asset presence + not-draft + exists.
